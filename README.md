# MachineLearningWithPokemon
This is a bunch of example Regression Models trained from pokemon! If Smogon ever tiers more pokemon for Gen 9, that will massively improve the dataset. Everything below Rarely Used(RU) has been reduced to Zero Use(ZU) as my eyes were glazing over working on the CSV. Id like to thank mrdew25 on kaggle for the original dataset.
